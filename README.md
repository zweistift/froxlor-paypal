Hi!

I created a AddOn for Foxlor with wich you can enable PayPal subscriptions for Clients. Your clients can log into their accounts, can press "Subscripe with Paypal" and it automaticly shows them if their hosting-subscription is paid.

After implementation it looks like this (Client Mode):

#####User's monthly rate is not paid:

#####User's monthly rate is paid, it offers to cancel the subscription:

#How it Works
You're able to create subscriptions for your clients via Paypal. Paylal will do all payment-stuff.
You have to create PayPal-Subscription Abos in your enterprise PayPal account.
You have to register he same subscriptions in froxlor with the PayPal Subscription Codes (PayPal Button Code).
So you'll register a Client and add a subscription. Next time your client will log in he see's the PayPal button. He subscribe the product then. If a subscription is done, PayPal will send a IPN (you have to tell the url of the listener to PayPal.) Froxlor takes the IPN and will set the customer as payed an expire date of a month. When PayPal bills the client next time, another IPN will send and your clients account automatically update his expire date.

#Installtion

##Prerequisites
Please make sure that you use the latest stable version of Froxlor (actually it is v.0.9.33).

###Make your DB ready

Execute **sql-preparations.sql** in mysql.


###Create IPN Listener
Create a Paypal Business Acount and create a "instant payment notification" server.

Create some subscription Buttons and save the code of the buttons place.

###Copying files
Copy the file **function.getPayOverview.php** into *froxlor/lib/functions/output/*
It will be automaticly loaded into PHP at every page-visit.


I also wrote a simpler PHP Function  for mysql(i) - DB AccessÂ (Testing...). It's a little simpler than the other way. Copy the file **function.getDatabase.php** in the same Folder :: edit --> i removed it from source in v.1.0

###Edit Area File
Edit the *froxlor/customer_index.php* -File. It has some sections in it. Paste this code into the IF-Clause $page == 'overview'
```

if ($page == 'overview'){

    ... froxlor-code
    
    $PP_info = getPayOverview($userinfo);
    
    ... froxlor-code
}
```
It will call the Function with the parameter $userinfo, Froxlor stores the userdata from the actual user in it. In the Function we gonna get the Data from the client and will put it in the variable $PP_Info

###Post Variable in the Theme
We have to define where our AddOn should appear:
*froxlor/templates/Sparke/customer/index/* **index.tpl**

Just post the variable between news feed and the Details Table
```
<div class="grid-u-1-2">
    <If Settings::Get('customer.show_news_feed') == '1'>
    ...
    </if>
    
    $PP_Info
    
    <table class="dboarditem">
    ...
```



Froxlor will call the Client-Index-Theme and paste his variables in it. So we have 










####Roadmap 08-01-15:
* while creating Clients offer a ABO select schalter
* autoupdate expire && payed state




###Licence
Please notice that I don't offer any source-code from Froxlor, It's just an AddOn wich you can self-integrate. 
You're not allowed to sell it under your name! ..
